## Win 10 Tools to remove annoyances or add useful features
Just download/clone my project. I don't want to restore to the default settings so there is no tool to restore it. If you want to restore, search on Google.

### Remove All User Folders From This PC (64 bit)

Simply run the file then restart Explorer (This PC)

### Active Windows Photo Viewer
Active the old Photo Viewer for you to use. It's still there but hidden.

### Disable Error Reporting
When your app crashes, it will ask you to find solution on web. Never use it so turn it off is better.

### Show Command Prompt on Win + X Menu
When you press Win + X or right click on windows button on the bottom left, it's now display PowerShell instead of CMD. This will reverse it and display CMD.

### SleepStudy.Bat
Somehow Microsoft messed up and this SleepStudy will make our disk usage 100% everytime. Run the file will help. See the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPOwecmjRoU).

### Cmd Shift Click Menu.reg
This will allow you to open CMD at the folder you're shift + right clicking. Restart after running the tool.
